# Create Your Account

<Steps>
### Pick a Plan

The first step to start using ShieldSign is to pick a plan and create an account.

Explore each plan's features and choose the one that best suits your needs.

> All plans are subject to our [Fair Use Policy](https://github.com/KatalystDigital/shieldsign-core/blob/main/apps/documentation/pages/users/fair-use.mdx).

### Create an account

If you are unsure which plan to choose, you can start with the free plan and upgrade later.

Navigate to the registration page at `https://your-domain.com/signup` and fill in the required information.

### Optional: Claim a Premium Username

You can claim a premium username by upgrading to a paid plan. After upgrading to a paid plan, you can update your public profile in your settings.

### Optional: Create a Team

If you are working with others, you can create a team and invite your team members to collaborate on your documents. More information about teams is available in the [Teams section](https://github.com/KatalystDigital/shieldsign-core/blob/main/apps/documentation/pages/users/organisations/teams.mdx).
