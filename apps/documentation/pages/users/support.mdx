# Support

## Community Support

If you are a developer or free user, you can reach out to the community or raise an issue:

### [Create Github Issues](https://github.com/KatalystDigital/shieldsign-core/issues)

The community and the core team address GitHub issues. Be sure to check if a similar issue already exists. Please note that while we want to address everything immediately, we must prioritize.

## Self-Hosted Support

For self-hosted instances, please refer to the documentation and open GitHub issues for bugs or feature requests.
