# Email Preferences

Email preferences allow you to set the default settings when emailing documents to your recipients.

## Preferences

Email preferences can be set on either the organisation or team level.

By default, teams inherit the preferences from the organisation. You can override these preferences on the team level at any time.

To access the preferences, navigate to either the organisation or teams settings page and click the **Email** tab under the **Preferences** section.

- **Default Email** - Use a custom email address when sending documents to your recipients. See [email domains](https://github.com/KatalystDigital/shieldsign-core/blob/main/apps/documentation/pages/users/email-domains.mdx) for more information.
- **Reply To** - The email address that will be used in the "Reply To" field in emails
- **Email Settings** - Which emails to send to recipients during document signing
